# WEB701 Fruit Juice Auction Site

## TO RUN THIS PROJECT

Firstly, ensure that you run the WEBDBCreation.sql query using MySQL, and make sure that your server/config.js file matches your database settings (which it should if you're using the default root/root username and password settings).

Secondly, run ```npm install``` inside both the client and server folders, to ensure that all dependancies are installed for the project to run.

Lastly, start the server and the client using the ```npm start``` commands, the website should now function correctly.
